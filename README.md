Improving the Doginals Project
.env File Setup:

Make sure that the .env file contains the correct node information.
The NODE_RPC_URL should point to your Dogecoin node with the correct IP and port.
NODE_RPC_USER and NODE_RPC_PASS must match the credentials in your dogecoin.conf.
Network Configuration Check:

Ensure that the IP and port in NODE_RPC_URL are accessible from the machine where the script runs.
If you're running the node locally, use http://127.0.0.1:<rpcport>.
Dogecoin.conf Settings Validation:

Your dogecoin.conf should have the correct rpcuser, rpcpassword, and rpcport settings.
Make sure server=1 is set to enable RPC commands.
Transaction Handling Improvement:

I'll add error handling to provide clearer messages when a transaction fails to broadcast.
Validate inputs and outputs of transactions for correctness.
Code Refactoring for Robustness:

Refactor the code to enhance readability, maintainability, and error handling.
This includes checking all function calls and API interactions for potential issues.
Testing Enhancements:

Implement test cases to cover wallet operations, minting, and error scenarios.
Test both on the mainnet and testnet, controlled by the TESTNET flag in .env.
Documentation Update:

Update the README.md to include any new steps or important information after changes.
Optional - User Interface Improvement:

If needed, a simple CLI interface can be added for better user interaction with the script.
